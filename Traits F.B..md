## Artificer
### Magical Tinkering

> At 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

> - The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
>
> - Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
>
> - The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
>
> - A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

> The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

> You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### Spellcasting
> You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

**Tools Required**

> You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus - specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool - in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.

> After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.
### Spellcasting Ability
> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Infuse Item
> At 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

**Infusions Known**

> When you gain this feature, pick four [artificer infusions](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer:infusions) to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

> Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

#### [Artificer Infusions](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer:infusions)
##### Armor of Tools
**_Item: A suit of armor_**
>As an action, a creature wearing this infused armor can integrate into it artisan’s tools or thieves’ tools. The tools remain integrated in the armor for 8 hours or until the wearer removes the tools as an action. The armor can have only one tool integrated at a time. The wearer can add its Intelligence modifier to any ability checks it makes with the integrated tool. The wearer must have a hand free to use the tool.
##### Enhanced Defense
**_Item: A suit of armor or a shield_**
>A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.

>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.
##### Mind Sharpener
**_Item: A suit of armor or robes_**
>The infused item can send a jolt to the wearer to refocus their mind. The item has 4 charges. When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the wearer can use its reaction to expend 1 of the item's charges to succeed instead. The item regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
##### Repeating Shot
**_Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)_**
>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.

>If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

## Toxicologist

### Blowgun Master
At 3rd level, you accompany your research of poisons with training on administering them from range. You gain the following benefits:
> - You gain proficiency with blowguns.
> - When you attack with a blowgun, you can use your
>Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
> - Standard blowgun needles you use deal 1d4 bonus poison damage or acid damage (your choice) on a hit.
> - When you take the Attack action, you can stow one item you’re holding and draw a blowgun as part of that action.
> - Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls using a blowgun.
### Arcane Toxins
> Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a vial, magically adding an injection needle onto the vial and filling it with an arcane toxin. When you create the toxin, you choose its effect from the Arcane Toxins table. Creating an arcane toxin requires you to have a poisoner’s kit on your person, and any toxin you create with this feature lasts until it is injected or until the end of your next long rest. The injection needles are magic weapons that can be used as blowgun ammunition or improvised melee weapons. When a filled injection needle hits a creature, it deals the normal damage of a blowgun needle and injects its entire contents into the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your artificer spell save DC. The effect of this saving throw is based on the toxin chosen. Needles that miss can usually be recovered and reused unless intentionally destroyed, as the magic used to create an injection needle also strengthens it When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more arcane toxins at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Each toxin requires its own vial. You can create additional arcane toxins by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the toxin in an empty vial you touch, and you choose the toxin’s effect from the Arcane Toxins table. If you expend a slot of 2nd level or higher, the toxin deals 1d6 bonus poison damage on a hit for each slot level above 1st.
#### Death
The target takes 4d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### Mind Fog
The target takes 1d6 poison damage. On a failed save, whenever the target makes an attack roll or a saving throw during the next minute, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature immune to poison is immune to this effect.
#### Paranoia
On a failed save, the target is frightened of all creatures it can see for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature immune to poison is immune to this effect.
#### Sickness
The target takes 2d6 poison damage. On a failed save, it is also poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
