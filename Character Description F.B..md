#### Flynn's Origins
This particular story starts relatively close to the center of the Klorian Galaxy where an ocean world called Thaloria B orbits in a binary system. On a crescent shape island in a town called Driftcove lived Mirelle; a devout cleric of Aestus, the god of oceans and moons. Mirelle Blackthorn, had been on a perilous sea-bound quest when a planar convergence occurred. An extraordinary event where the boundaries between 2 planes, in this case the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Water grew thin, flooding the world with raw, untamed magic. A sudden and violent storm erupted, far beyond anything she had encountered, with waves that shimmered with ethereal light and winds that carried a haunting, otherworldly melody.

At the heart of the storm, Mirelle found herself enveloped by a vortex of raw magical energy spilling from the elemental plane. The power was overwhelming, coursing through her like a flood. When the convergence ended and the seas calmed, Mirelle was left changed—her body marked with thorn-like patterns of arcane energy and a strange, inexplicable awareness that she now carried a child.

Months later, Flynn was born during another storm, this one smaller yet no less significant. The neighbors whispered of divine intervention, calling him a child of the storm, brought into existence by the will of Aestus.
## Backstory
Flynn Blackthorn’s name was once spoken in hushed reverence in the academic halls of medical research. Hailed as a prodigy, he earned dual doctorates in neurology and toxicology at the age of 19, quickly becoming one of the brightest minds in his field. His reputation was built on a single-minded pursuit: to find a cure for a strange neurological disease that had afflicted his younger brother.

In his heart, Flynn was driven by a need to save his sibling, to reverse the tide of fate that had threw his family in turmoil. While at Neridion University of Bioengineering he turned to neurotoxins, a study in poisons, hoping to reverse-engineer a treatment. What began as an academic exercise soon became an obsession. Flynn threw himself into researching and experimenting, blurring ethical lines as his desperation grew.

His brother died before Flynn could perfect the formula. A cruel twist of fate that broke him in ways even his sharp mind couldn’t comprehend. As he clung to what little remained—his work, his ambition—Flynn's rash decisions led to an experiment gone wrong. A life was lost, and the medical community turned its back on him. His career shattered by scandal, Flynn was cast aside, his once-brilliant future now a distant dream. His parents, having no other choice, distanced themselves from him when the news about his fall from grace started to spread across the Cerentine Empire. Feeling responsible for not being able to save his brother, he tries to stay in contact with his parents as best he can, from time to time sending them some money, and occasionally meeting them at his brother's grave, but they are still quite cold and distant whenever they meet.

At 23, with the small fortune he had acquired from his few years as a accomplished scientist, Flynn took to the stars. He purchased a small but fast, nimble spaceship and became a mercenary. Yet, despite his fall from grace, he didn’t abandon his first love: medicine. His ship is filled with vials of neurotoxins, data, and experiments that he continues to refine as he travels around in search of new reactants; he takes odd jobs as a combat medic, stitching up wounded and applying his expertise as a doctor to help others.

## Appearance

His skin, a striking blue, marks him as a water Genasi, his hair black and messy. His eyes, a vibrant blue that can pierce the soul, betraying an intelligence that never rests.

His attire reflects both his past and present: a modified lab coat that serves as much as armor as it does a symbol of his former life. Beneath it, a skintight, bulletproof carbon-fiber shirt hugs his frame, a thin but strong material capable of withstanding few blows during firefights. The forearms are the most telling part of his appearance—sleek, cybernetic, crafted from medical-grade alloys. His right forearm houses a dart-gun, capable of delivering a lethal dose of neurotoxin with deadly accuracy, while his left contains a multifaceted PDA, a tool he’s crafted for both his research and his mercenary work.

## Personality

To the untrained eye, Flynn is the calmest of men, a doctor who has seen the darkest moments of life and walked through them with unshaken composure. The result of years spent in high-pressure environments, learning to project confidence so that his patients might find peace in his stead. But beneath this calm is a maelstrom of self-doubt, an anxiety that eats away at him from within.

Flynn’s greatest insecurity is not in his science, but in his identity. He knows the complexities of neurochemistry better than anyone, and he can manipulate poisons with the precision of a surgeon. But beyond that, he’s terrified of being exposed as a fraud—someone who doesn’t understand the things that others take for granted (like cooking or romance). In moments when he finds himself in uncharted territory, be it in a battle or in conversation, Flynn will lie, feign confidence, and hope no one sees the cracks in his knowledge.

## Connections
## Mother
### Mirelle Blackthorn

**Race:** Sea Elf  
**Age:** 286 (Appears late 30s to early 40s)  
**Class:** Cleric (Tempest Domain)  
**Deity:** Aestus, a deity of Oceans and Moons
**Occupation:** Marine Biologist
#### Appearance
Mirelle’s pale skin glistens faintly with a sheen reminiscent of ocean spray. Her silver-white hair falls in long, wavy locks, perpetually tousled by an invisible breeze. Her eyes are like storm-tossed seas, shifting hues of deep blue and grey.

The most striking feature of Mirelle is the intricate network of black, thorn-like patterns that wind up her arms and across her back, converging around her shoulders and neck. These markings appeared after the conception of her son, Flynn Blackthorn. The vines shimmer faintly in the moonlight or when submerged in water, glowing with an otherworldly bioluminescence that seems to pulse with her heartbeat. During moments of intense emotion or when she channels divine magic, the markings writhe subtly, almost as if alive.

## Stepfather
### Xavier Teyros
**Race:** Half Sea Elf / Half Astral Elf
**Age:** 242 (Appears in his mid-30s)  
**Class:** Paladin (Oath of Progress)
**Occupation:** Senior Executive of Aquatech Innovations

#### Appearance:
Xavier is a lean, tall Aquari with sleek, smooth skin that resembles polished metal, a silvery-grey tone flecked with faint turquoise undertones. His hair is short and jet black, always neatly combed to maintain an air of professionalism. His eyes are a cold, pale blue, often scanning the room with a focused but impersonal gaze through his rectangular glasses, rarely showing much emotion. His features are angular and sharp, carrying a sense of both efficiency and distance. A faint shimmer of bioluminescence often glows from beneath his skin, a result of his aquatic heritage, though it’s subtle and rarely noticed unless he's submerged in water. He often wears tailored corporate attire or business suits, favoring practicality and status over anything else.
#### Personality:
Xavier is driven by the demands of his job and the pursuit of success, viewing relationships as obligations rather than emotional connections. While he’s not neglectful of Flynn, his attention is often diverted by work or personal interests, leaving him to fulfill the role of a stepfather more out of duty than genuine care. He provides for the family well, ensuring they have everything they need materially, but struggles with emotional bonding, especially with Flynn.

The relationship with his stepson, Flynn, is one of practical care. He makes sure Flynn has a good education, offers occasional advice, and makes sure he’s safe, but he doesn’t offer warmth or emotional support. He doesn't understand the magical changes Flynn is going through, and even if he does, he’s far more interested in ensuring his son’s potential usefulness in the future rather than nurturing a meaningful bond.
